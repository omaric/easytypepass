Generate passwords that are easy to type

People who care about security use hard to crack passwords, generally generated by a password generator to have a random mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Those four requirements are usually required for website passwords, along with a minimum length and other requirements. However, a password like `3gK*&>5%bZY)sH:D` can be hard to type, especially on certain devices. For example, typing out passwords for video game consoles is a huge annoyance, as you generally have to hunt and peck with a cursor across a software keyboard. That cursor is controlled by your video game controller, not your fingers as in the case of a mobile phone keyboard or hardware keyboard.

It would be easier to type such passwords with a better keyboard. But since we can't make our phones input passwords to our game consoles, nor do we want to pay for expensive game console keyboards, it's simpler to just generate a password that's easy to type. What would make the passwords easy to type? Putting all the types of characters next to each other. Uppercase letters go in one set of characters, lowercase letters go in another set of characters, numbers and symbols, also go next to each other so you're not constantly switching the keyboard type for every character you input.

What about security? You can still keep good security by having a password be long, using a crypto-safe pseudorandom selection, not only for each character, but the order of the character type sections. If you like, you can add extra sections, picked randomly of course. A password of `3045krkfEYTB{+:_` is hard to crack. A bad actor doesn't know the order of the sections, nor do they know which characters are selected within each section.

Let's compare how many options there are for this four-section password with a section length of four characters: [include math here]

Meanwhile, you only switch keyboard types (from default to number to lowercase to uppercase to symbols) a maximum of four times. That's way fewer than the 13 keyboard switches needed to type `3gK*&>5%bZY)sH:D`, a password of equal length but not much more secure than our easy-type-pass. Try it out if you like it.
